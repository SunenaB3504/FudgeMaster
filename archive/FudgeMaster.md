### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This document comprehensively specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for "FinFlow," a web-based interactive accounting learning application. It is meticulously designed for Class 11th and 12th standard CBSE students in India. The primary goal is to transform traditional accounting learning into an engaging, effective, and intuitive experience through interactive modules, a full accounting cycle simulation, and a Gen-Z-centric user interface. This SRS serves as the foundational blueprint for the application's development, design, and testing.

* **Class 12:** Accounting for Partnership Firms (Fundamentals, Reconstitution, Dissolution), Accounting for Companies (Share Capital, Debentures), Analysis of Financial Statements (Comparative, Common Size, Ratios), and Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method).

The application will feature interactive learning modules, practice problems, a full accounting cycle simulation ("Transaction Cruncher"), and dedicated exam preparation tools. It will be accessible via web browsers on desktops/laptops and mobile devices, supporting cloud-based user authentication and data storage for seamless progress tracking.

#### 1.3 Target Audience
The primary user is a CBSE Class 11th or 12th standard student (typically aged 15-18) in India. This demographic is characterized by a strong familiarity with digital interfaces, a preference for visual and interactive content, immediate feedback, and gamified learning experiences.

## 1. Overview
This document details the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) procedures, expected outputs, and severity levels for each deployment phase of the FudgeMaster web app.

## 2. UAT Phases & Procedures

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- **Procedure:**
  - Verify repository setup and folder structure
  - Test authentication and landing page accessibility
  - Review documentation for completeness

  - All folders/files present
  - Users can register/login
  - Landing page loads without errors
- **Severity:**
  - Critical: Authentication failure, missing core folders
  - Major: Broken links, incomplete documentation

### Phase 2: Core Modules Development (MVP)
- **Procedure:**
  - Test Class 11 & 12 modules for content delivery and quizzes
  - Validate mind map navigation and UI
  - Check table formats and rules modules
- **Expected Output:**
  - All modules load and display correct content
  - Mind map nodes are clickable and link to correct modules
  - Table formats render as per CBSE standards
- **Severity:**
  - Critical: Module fails to load, navigation broken
  - Major: Incorrect content, table format errors
  - Minor: UI misalignment, slow loading

### Phase 3: Interactive Features
- **Procedure:**
  - Test custom transaction simulation for entry, validation, and feedback
  - Validate adaptive feedback and gamification features
  - Check accessibility, voiceover, and chatbot modules
- **Expected Output:**
  - Transactions are validated and feedback is accurate
  - Gamification elements update correctly
  - Accessibility features work (screen reader, keyboard navigation)
- **Severity:**
  - Critical: Validation logic fails, feedback not generated
  - Major: Gamification not updating, accessibility non-compliance
  - Minor: Audio glitches, chatbot delays

### Phase 4: Advanced Functionality & Review
- **Procedure:**
  - Test old question paper review module for loading, attempting, and analytics
  - Validate analytics, progress tracking, and reporting
  - Review continuous improvement and feedback modules
- **Expected Output:**
  - Question papers load and can be attempted
  - Analytics and progress tracking are accurate
  - Feedback is collected and changelog updates
- **Severity:**
  - Critical: Papers not loading, analytics incorrect
  - Major: Progress not tracked, feedback lost
  - Minor: Report formatting issues

### Phase 5: Production Release & Continuous Delivery
- **Procedure:**
  - Test production deployment for stability and performance
  - Monitor feedback collection and update notifications
  - Validate rollback and recovery procedures
- **Expected Output:**
  - App is stable, responsive, and error-free
  - Feedback is collected and updates are notified
  - Rollback works in case of failure
- **Severity:**
  - Critical: App crash, data loss
  - Major: Update notifications missing, rollback fails
  - Minor: Performance lags, UI inconsistencies

## 3. Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Prevents core functionality, must be fixed before release
- **Major:** Affects major features, should be fixed in current phase
- **Minor:** Cosmetic or non-blocking, can be scheduled for future sprints

## 4. UAT Reporting
- All issues logged with phase, procedure, expected output, actual result, and severity
- Daily UAT summary and sprint-end review

## 5. Summary
